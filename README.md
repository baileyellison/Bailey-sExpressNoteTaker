# Bailey's Express Note Taker

## Description
This refractored code web application allows the user to take notes, save them and delte them. The notes save in the db.json file, which allows the user to go into the documentation and look at all previous notes. The application was built using html, bootstrap CSS framework, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and express. The features include a landing page with a user interface, then a title and paragraph text size so the user can enter notes. Unique id's are saved to the db.json, so they can each be viewed and accessed at a later date with a unique ID.
